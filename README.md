# Unofficial stable builds of Zed for Windows

**NOTE: This is not a support channel for Zed on Windows.**

These builds are for those who want to live on the bleeding edge or just want to test Zed out on Windows. 

Any issues with the Windows build should go through official channels, as this repository does not concern itself with the source code of Zed or issues found therein. 

If you have suggestions for improvements to the build process, please start a discussion or make a PR. 

## Is it safe?

This repository is just a [simple GitHub workflow](./.github/workflows/build.yml) that builds Zed from `main` and publishes a release every 12 hours (UTC+0000). (Additionally on push for testing).

See the [Zed homepage](https://zed.dev/) or [official repository](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) for more details.
